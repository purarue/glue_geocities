This is my personal website [glue](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/glue) converted from elixir to a static site at [this commit](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/glue/tree/b163eec87183a32758f786363a99b91fe6009eda) circa ~July 2020

It has [since evolved to something else](https://sean.fish/), but I wanted to have a working version of this up somewhere

This was not actually hosted on [geocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities) (I'm a bit too young for that), it was just inspired by:

- https://www.cameronsworld.net/
- https://gifcities.org/
- https://twitter.com/geocitiesbot
